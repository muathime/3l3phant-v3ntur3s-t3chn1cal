# Fullstack Wanted App (Frontend + Backend)

This project contains a fullstack application with both frontend and backend in this same repo.

## Quick Start with Docker

To run the entire app using Docker

```
docker compose up --build
```

This will start both the frontend (on http://localhost:5173) and the backend (on http://localhost:3000).

## Running Without Docker
If you prefer running individually without containerization

Refer to
```
1. `frontend/README.md` for local frontend setup
2. `backend/README.md` for local backend setup
```
